"While children are less likely than adults to get seriously ill or die from Covid, they are just as susceptible to infection and just as easily spread the disease to others as adults do. (Proven fact.) A significant proportion of our population is at risk of death regardless of whether they've been vaccinated -- the elderly, cancer patients, etc. Those groups are being killed by unvaccinated people who are spreading this disease to them. Colin Powell was likely killed by some unvaccinated person who unwittingly infected him with Covid. Get vaccinated. Consider others, not just yourself.",0,No
With over 3 billion vaccines given worldwide and it's safety and efficacy well documented this is one of the most researched and proven vaccines in history. Science!,0,No
"Vaccinated persons are less likely to be infectious, and when so, for a much more limited time than are unvaccinated persons. Get vaccinated and stop denying facts, Kizzy.",0,No
"So which is it? Is it ""unproven""? Or are you worried about the long term effects? Because those are 2 different things? Or do you just change your argument when one is shown to be BS? As for long term effects, to the best of my knowledge there has never been any long term negative effects from a vaccine. And if you are so concerned about long term effects, why are you not more worried about Covid, which has shown to have long term effects and we do not know if there could be even more long term effects?",0,No
Only fools would object to protecting our children. Can you imagine anyone objecting when we were vaccinating children against polio and smallpox (and eradicated those diseases in the process)?,0,No
State sponsored Child Abuse !,1,Yes
Donâ€™t poison your babies!,1,Yes
"600,000 postal workers are exempt, but they want to jab our children with poisonÂ ",1,Yes
"not really, nobody knows the long term effects, plus it should be a choice just like H1N1 was",1,Yes
Giving your kids these experimental drugs because you're a neurotic who is afraid of them catching a cold is tantamount to child abuse,1,Yes
"We all need to protect ourselves. By protecting ourselves we protect others. Do everything you can, including getting vaccinated but more importantly in my opinion is the social distance. Remember that it doesn't matter if you have the vaccine or not. Exposure can be fatal if you are high risk.",0,No
Seriously?? Blaming her death on unvaxxed! How do you people sleep at night?,0,No
"So if she was vaccinated, she could have caught it from another vaccinated person just as easily as an unvaccinated person.",0,No
Everyone should get vaccinated,0,No
All you can do to avoid covid is avoid gathering even if you are vaccinated and consider yourself as a person who is not vaccinated even after getting vaccinated,0,No
"CDC Director said in Aug, the vaccine doesn't stop spread..",1,Yes
She could have been infect by those that have been vaccinated.100% factual. Follow the science,1,Yes
Meanwhile the vaccinated are also spreading it so how are the unvaccinated to blame?,1,Yes
Why get vax if it doesn't protect you?,1,Yes
Let me run out and get the vaccine and then get covid and then what..... This story is exactly why I will not get the vaccine!,1,Yes
why get the vaccine if it doesnt work,0,No
Kids are important and need protection to could be more happier keep kids safe,0,No
How can so many seemingly intelligent people be so clueless ,0,No
Fearing the vaccine more than dying from Covid? That’s just bonkers,1,Yes
I wish they’d fear transmitting the virus to other people,1,Yes
Of all the people healthcare workers should be vaccinated,0,No
I had my Two shots and I'm fine,1,Yes
They're health care workers! Getting vaccinated should be a no brainer. Get vaccinated or find another job! Geez,0,No

Vaccinations should be withdrawn they are dangerous,1,Yes
Crimes against humanity.,1,Yes
Doesn't seem to be effecting the tens of thousands at sporting events,0,No
Got my Moderna shot. Glad I did.The best one out of them all,0,No
Thank you president Trump for your great leadership and dedication in the development of the vaccine,0,No
Got my Moderna Jan no problems at all. And I have chronic persistent asthma,0,No
More side effects have been reported with Moderna,1,Yes
Why would you risk permanent heart damage for your children by taking an experimental medicine when itÕs totally unnecessary??,1,Yes
No vaccine mandate for illegal alien children just our children. Got it! Taliban Joe is a disaster!,1,Yes
I had read a few weeks ago that the Moderna seems to be slightly more effective against the Delta Variant as well. I really wish that they would get this one approved for children.,0,No
Does not matter! My kids will not receive it!,1,Yes

"Thank you for making UofM safer for everyone who wants to be there. Don't want a vaccine, go to school somewhere else then.",0,No
"Better late than never, pretty? In the interim what neazures are you taking to reduce and eliminate chances of spreading the virus?",0,No
I think if somebody is unvaccinated but had Covid then a positive antibody test should be a medical reason for not getting the vaccine. There’s not much discussion now of natural immunity being part of achieving herd immunity which is odd to me. The CDC studies I’ve seen show less than 1% of those with natural immunity are reinfected. I get regular antibody tests and still have strong antibodies after 9 months which is longer right now than the estimated immunity from the vaccine since they are talking about needing a booster after 6 months.,0,No
Good…want my doc’s office to be as virus free as possible…,0,No
"It is not freedom issue. It is a compassion issue. Compassion for your fellow man. Otherwise, it is a selfish issue.",1,Yes

No one is above the law. Truth matters.,0,No
Poor guy! That’s just awful. Prayers for her family!,0,No
Great news!,0,No
Small numbers of test subjects. No long term data. For a cold that is less dangerous to kids then the flu.,1,Yes
Good. Tired of hearing about this case. There are horrific crimes everyday. I fail to understand why this one was so important.,1,Yes
Keep it away from my kids. We all have antibodies we don't need a man made chemical injected into our body for a virus with a 99% survival rate.,1,Yes
She cant hide those lying eyes!,1,Yes
"The crime in Pine Bluff has always been bad, but this seems like a new low. Something needs to be done there.",1,Yes
The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination.,1,Yes
"Get ready for those mandates. No vaccine? No job, No grocery shopping, No drivers lisence, No freedom.",0,No
You cannot mandate something that isn't 100% you're walking a slippery slope Baker. Look how well it worked out when you tried to mandate the flu shot for children! mandates aren't even law!,1,Yes
COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage,1,Yes
"It's better to lose your job than take these experimental ""vaccines"" and permanently damage your health or even cost you your life.",1,Yes
"With 17,000 deaths from the vaccine and more than 60,000 serious adverse reactions, the Governor is acting responsibly for the freedom, and wellbeing of all Texans! No wonder why so many Americans are now moving there!",0,No
More money for Pfizer and moderna and Bill Gates and fauci! Unfortunately it's incredibly dangerous to give these injections to children. And besides they aren't at risk of catching covid! This must be stopped!,0,No
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not get the COVID-19 vaccine.,1,Yes
"If employees are so uneducated and backward they refuse vaccines they may not be the kind of employees you want in the first place. You want the job, get vaccinated.",0,No
There are severe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,1,Yes
Vaccinated people are still much less likely to be hospitalized or die because of COVID-19.,0,No
Vaccinate yourself for good health and mask up.,0,No
I am delighfull to get my first dose of vaccine,0,No
I feel more healthy after taking the first dose,0,No
vaccination is a neccessity,0,No
I know many people who for health reasons have been told not to get the shot.,1,Yes
A vaccine may temporarily affect your period,1,Yes
I’m not going to be a Guinea pig for a rushed vaccine that has barely been studied.,1,Yes
Half of you are crazy. Why would anyone take the vaccine,1,Yes
Absolutely not nobody knows what kind of side effects it might have.,1,Yes
"Thank you Betsy DeVos, Thank you Donald, oops I mean, Ron DeSantis, Thank you Former Guy in Mar-a-Lago. Introducing and promoting brainlessness, dangerous folly, and outright stupidity into mainstream American families deserves some sort of prize - the National Award for Conspiracy Mongering and Irrationality would do fine.",1,Yes
"80 thousand football maskless fans cheering their football teams at packed stadiums across the country. Thousands standing shoulder to shoulder without the obedience masks at hockey games. Every day we eat at restaurants, maskless. We shop at malls, maskless, we go to clubs, maskless. Meanwhile, COVID infection rates are rapidly declining. Yet our kids are forced to wear face diapers for 8 hours a day for no other reason than to control. For the sake of power. Nurses and doctors who heroically dealt with and nursed patients back from the brink of death during the onset of COVID when it was not known what effect the virus would have on them, many who got COVID and now have the antibodies are being fired, because they choose not to take the vacine. Cops, firefighters, teachers, air traffic controllers, pilots also. ESPN reporter Allison Williams who is trying to concieve a child and was told by her doctor not to take the vaccine, was fired. But this is what bothers the Miami Herald. That a school says kids who take the vaccine must be quarantined for 30 days at home. It's a private school. Parents can choose to take their kids out, but they don't. It doesn't bother the parents, but it bothers the Miami Herald.",1,Yes
The new covid cases are 7 to 1 vaccianted to those whom had covid and have natural immunity.But you blind indoctrinated sheep just spew idiocy here day and night.,1,Yes
Miki Elior Like Colin Powell died. Fully vaccinated. My point exactly.,1,Yes
"Candy Perrita BS! Many more unvaccinated are dying than the vaccinated. Yes, you can get it and spread it after being vaccinated but you have a much greater chance of not being hospitalized nor dying. During the Delta surge 97% of the hospitalized and 99% of the deaths were unvaccinated people. Ya' frickin' DING DONG!",0,No
"When will this lunacy end? For decades we have faced health emergencies/epidemics and the public have all responded responsibly. I dutifully lined up to get my polio vaccine and my parents were so relieved that I most probably would escape the ravishes of polio. But today, because Trump tells them there is no need for a vaccine (and DeSantis also promotes that misinformation), irresponsible, irrational, illogical, reckless people refuse the established public health protocols and we are all going to die because of it. Mindless and indefensible. If you refuse to be vaccinated and to wear a mask, stay home and do not come out and infect me with your stupid, politically motivated behavior. Remember, it is not just all about yourself as Trump says. Rather it is responsibility for the entire community. What about 'We the people....' do you not understand?",0,No
Complete and Total LUNACY in our midst. 0Always better to be SAFE than SORRY. Always better to be CAREFUL than CARELESS. Always better to think LOGICALLY than listen to RUMORS. ?,0,No
"So, explain how and why very close to 100% of the COVID patients in the hospitals, on ventilators, and dying are unvaccinated! The data could not be clearer. Only the pathetically incompetent, irrational, illogical, irresponsible, and reckless would continue to refuse to be vaccinated and to wear masks when in close contact with others. These are the same people who drive on the 826 at 90 mph with their eyes closed. Mindless. Dios Mio.",0,No
"Chuck, come on now, the reason for children & teachers wearing masks (they're not diapers!) in a closed classroom is totally necessary, to keep students & staff from catching this plague-- Too many people are still dying, & children should not be put in the middle of this pandemic! The solution is for all people worldwide, children, parents, nurses & doctors to get both shots of this fully necessary FDA approved vaccine, to lower the number of cases and deaths by the end of 2021!",0,No
"You pulled that claim out of your rear end. Vaccinated people can get COVID, can spread COVID, and can die of COVID. More vaccinated people are dying of COVID than unvaccinated. Ask Colin Powell",1,Yes
I will be happy with my two Pfizer vaccinesÿ,0,No
But your vaccine will protect you!,0,No
The vaccine is a blessing on us,0,No
No side effects after the vaccine had my second one and feeling great,0,No
I am happy that I got vaccinated.I am safe.,0,No
I?m so sick of reading about people dying with or without a vaccine. ,1,Yes
ÿToo many health issues with this vaccine.,1,Yes
I have read a lot of harmful effects including death if taken the vaccine,1,Yes
This is not a vaccine it is a death shot,1,Yes
There are some people who have died from the vaccine but they're not ready to talk about that...,1,Yes
Thank you to all the employees who value the health and lives of Washingtonï¿½s people.,1,Yes
"I am not surprised by the vaccination rates jumping up the WSP and I guarantee SPD numbers will go up too!! I knew when it came down to it these officers are not going to lose $100,000 a year job over a vaccines shot! Not too many other job paying that kind of money.",1,Yes
"The percentage jumped as the total number of those that didnï¿½t quit, transfer out of state, or take early retirement shrankï¿½.that should make you feel safeï¿½.",1,Yes
"The reality is that a lot of people really do respond to mandates. We donï¿½t use them much here in Japan besides obvious things like enrolling kids in school or working in healthcare, but that is because almost everybody seems eager to get vaccinated. Hence they arenï¿½t as necessary as they are in the US. In an ironic sense, vaccine refusal directly leads to vaccine mandates.",1,Yes
"The really encouraging thing is that the protection against hospitalization (and thus against death) shows no signs of waning after 6 months. The protection against infection does wane quite a bit, but remains quite significant compared to not being vaccinated.",1,Yes
Just like a flu vaccine! But with MORE effectiveness. No surprise at all. And as long as 1/4 of the population remains unvaccinated and riding on the coat tails of those that are. We are just going to have to repeat and repeatï¿½??,0,No
"90% for six months. Lol. Just trying to walk the line between ï¿½we told you this was effective, but now, we really want to sell you boosters too.ï¿½",0,No
lol so now they're protecting us from hospitalizations? What about protecting us from the virus? You can't make this up.,0,No
"Stop with your bullshit propaganda, not everybody is asleep. Why don't you expose the corruption of the CDC numbers? They are reporting people who died from vaccine reactions as unvaccinated to keep the numbers up. Why don't you publish new info from israel that shows people who have recovered and have natural immunity have a lower Risk by factor of 7 for re- infection compared to those who are vaccinated. It's right there on their govt health website. They are not politically biased and corrupted by big pharma like the medical establishment here. Not afraid of something with a lower death rate than the flu. Recently caught Delta variant my son brought home from school, a little bit of a runny nose and a sore throat for one day and a very light productive cough. Super easy to get over, barely an inconvenience. American News is not and has not been real journalism for decades. It's all about pushing whatever the current narrative is with a fervor comparable to Nazi propaganda. You suck ass Seattle Times",0,No
"It's crazy that people are allowing their political views to influence them on something that should be a non-political subject, and something that is good for all of us.",0,No
Really Most of the Delta variant infections are in the unvaccinated but there are breakthroughs in the vaccinated because this variant came out after the vaccines were developed. The unvaccinated will be responsible for additional variants that may cause even more breakthrough infections. We NEED to have herd immunity to overcome this virus!,0,No
It is ignorance and belief in conspiracy theories that cause people to make stupid decisions. I got my vaccine in February. Think about Polio and Small Pox! When I was in elementary school they came into the school and vaccinated all the children. Both diseases were eradicated due to vaccines. This is no different.,0,No
"By the way, I signed up to receive the vaccine immediately. Even though I am a healthcare worker, I did not receive my (first) vaccine until this past Monday. I was sick all week. With all of the information and mis-information that's been put out, the only reason I received the vaccine was to hopefully protect those that I care for. If I were on my own, I would have waited as well.",0,No
Get vaccinated. Don't let your fear cheat you or anyone out of life.,0,No
These millionaires need to step up & get vaccinated.,0,No
"Many scientists, doctors and nurses advise not to get the vaccine",1,Yes
Iâ€™m not a sheep and wonâ€™t be getting a shot that was rushed out!! A scared population is easy to control and thatâ€™s what our government wants!!think for yourselves ppl!!!,1,Yes
"If the vaccine actually worked, the vaccinated wouldn't have to worry about the unvaccinated.",1,Yes
"This is such total bs, the cdc announced yesterday that this vaccine they are pushing is ineffective . But, we know this, vaxed can still get and more importantly spread this virus. Its pointless. How much are these companies getting paid to ruin employees lives. Its truly pathetic.",1,Yes
I will gladly be fired before taking the jab. Big lawsuits will follow after the mid-terms.,1,Yes
"Smarter than all the ""adults"" who are refusing it!",0,No
Very true however the outcome is much much better the Mayo Clinic John Hopkins University The Lancet all have excellent regular updates to keep us informed !,0,No
that's ok! In two years they will be mouthy teenagers anyway! Parents will welcome the quiet!,0,No
amazing how many are scared of a life saving vaccine vs a serious deadly virus,0,No
Is their any chance this has been a wake up call to the youth of today ? Believe in science first & not the Hollywood world the are surrounded by very hard to find the truth in the World we live in !,0,No
A generation that can be so easily manipulated....,1,Yes
To each their own. The vaccine does not make you immune to COVID-19. Just because you get the vaccine does not mean you cannot get COVID-19.,1,Yes
In two years the vaccine will take over the body and they will all turn to zombies,1,Yes
"This is the follow-up question that everyone wants answered today. What about those 32338406 people who were ""Confirmed Cases"" in the U.S. during the last year? Why do they need to be vaccinated since they have natural immunity? Secondary question is how did those New York Yankee players end up with COVID-19? They were fully-vaccinated !!!",1,Yes
And which branch of science is your doctorate in?,1,Yes
The vaccine is useful. but I do not doubt that a strong immune system can fight it off without vaccination,0,No
Nanette Heathman um getting the shot is better than dying.,0,No
Nanette Heathman you are unvaccinated and can still get sick. Get the shot to save yourself.,0,No
Here's a ky study that shows covid survivors reinfection vac vs un vac. Spoiler- Vaxed survivors much better off https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm…,0,No
Total BS. It's now proven... no one has natural immunity. Many covid-19 patients caught it more than once and get hospitalized. And it's already proven in US with >620K deaths - path via natural immunity will be a disaster - with lots of people to die along the way. If it wasn't for the vaccine US probably would've added at least another 300K deaths more to what we already have.,0,No
Lydia E. Moseley moderna said their vaccine only provides coverage for 6 months. So there are a bunch people walking around with their card but no immunity.,1,Yes
Nanette Heathman your immunity is not forever. You may only have immunity for 3 months up to 10 months. You can definitely get it again.,1,Yes
Ann MoDe amd then you need a booster because they didnt work.Why take the jab if you arent getting sick? Why risk having the virus in your system if you havent been affected for almost 2 yrs,1,Yes
Lindie Black and many who have received the covid shots have also died  from covid,1,Yes
I had covid in November  got the J$J shot in March....but I'm still careful. I probably have immunity  but still wear mask and stay 6 feet from others,1,Yes

For all you parents who are excited about this you do know that the vaccine does not prevent transmission Plus the cdc just announced that kids should be masked in in school regardless of vax status,0,No
Its still hasn't been fda approved so it would be making these kids part of an experiment,1,Yes
Theyre firing them because they refuse to get the vaccine A lot of cops are career scumbags anyway so this will help them hire better cops,1,Yes
Chicago more kids die from street Violence yet Chicago is Firing police officers Not Political at all,1,Yes
"Sick is not the same as death, kids get sick all the time I was told at the hospital (way b4 Covid-19) they need to get sick to Build a healthy immune system Covid-19 is no different  but all do respect do what you think is best and luck to us all from this government control",1,Yes
Glad to hear this My kids will definitely be getting them as soon as possible Thankfully my 4 year old will be turning 5 next month,0,No

thats so great My 4 year old has just over 6 months left so I’m hoping 2-4 is authorized sooner,0,No
The vaccine is as safe as Covid-19 for kids  so makes sense just like eating Vegetables,0,No
Lmao. Fecking science is getting ridiculous,1,Yes
This is a joke ! Stay the hell away from the kids they aren’t Guinea pigs,1,Yes
keep this poison away from your children remember tens and thousands of healthcare workers are not even taking the jab. why is that? A mandate is not a law.,1,Yes
More garbage,1,Yes
How idiotic & childish,1,Yes

"500 deaths under the age of 18, in 2 years",1,Yes
Why risk it when you know it doesn't stop everyone from getting the China Virus? Makes sense to wait to see if they are able to come up with a real vaccine that actually prevents the illness.,0,No
"Of course it doesn’t. The data says that kids are more likely to develop. “However, if cases of COVID-19 were to fall to the low levels last seen in June, the FDA predicted the U.S. might not see enough severe COVID-19 cases in children to outnumber the incidents of myocarditis or pericarditis.”",1,Yes
Almost like death isn't the only consequence,1,Yes
I've seen too many videos of people administering the shots without first drawing back on the plunger to make sure the needle isn't in a blood vessel BEFORE administering the vaccines. Studies indicate that this error results in serious harm or death.,0,No

Covid kills fat people.,1,Yes
"F.... Joe Brandon and the democrats.. Fight for your rights, your right to medical privacy..",1,Yes
Who cares what it says,1,Yes
That study isn't even peer-reviewed yet it's a preprint. It literally says it shouldn't be used to guide medical practice yet this is lazy and irresponsible reporting,1,Yes
even 50% effectiveness is exponentially better than nothing. The desperation is funny to watch as their blind loyalty is literally killing them.,1,Yes
Horrible headline. When what you wanted to say is that you can still get it but still protective against severe illness. Do better please,1,Yes
That's so you can get your booster hahahaha they need the lab rats for the booster and Big Pharma can make more money. Follow the money.,1,Yes
Yeah I'll take my chances with 50% effectiveness. Hell even 10. Anything to curb the spread and squash this forever.,1,Yes
The difference between Pfizer and Moderna is Pfizer has to be diluted and Moderna does not. This was the information that made my decision to get the Moderna shot. Modern is still 93% effective 6 months later.,0,No
"Just like how the seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is ""revised"" every year from the 80-90+ percent clinical model to more like 30% efficacy in real world applications. No surprise. These vaccines are not a panacea. People need to accept that and adjust their habits according to their own tolerance for risk",0,No
Declining effectiveness is still better than not getting vaccinated.,0,No
It’s a study that was not particularly good had a ton of unknowns and basically said- need more studies.,0,No
Still a higher effectiveness than we were all hoping for a year ago,0,No
It is ridiculous that people freak out over this. As if the state owns you. They want you to do one thing. All the other things you do in life you can still do. They're just asking you to do something for your fellow citizens. It is selfish and stupidï¿½not to do it and I am so sorry that you are stuck in some sort of mental trap that puts you in situations to make such poor decisions. I sincerely mean it I am sorry your mind works the way it does. It has to be hard to be like that.,1,Yes
Thank you for justice,0,No
Letï¿½s just imagine if parents had blocked the polio vaccine.,0,No
Jacob Campbell we had the building blocks for this type of vaccine already in production years before covid hit (mrna vaccines are a potential cancer treatment). And we have now had two years of usage and study for these specific ones. The rest of theï¿½world produced their own in this time frame as well. Do you want the Indian vaccine? The Swedish one? The Chinese one? The Cuban one? The British one? I canï¿½t believe this argument is still happening,1,Yes
I mean...they have been requiring vaccines for years. This is just a new vaccine.,0,No
Before you know theyï¿½re going to make kids get vaccines to enroll in school!,1,Yes
Aaron Wagner Words of ignorance and selfishness for those that can't take it.have had bad side effects from it or have died from it.,1,Yes
It didn't need to be mandated. Parents wanted their kids to not die.ï¿½,1,Yes
Judy Hauser it was never mandated.,0,No
Judy Hauser Just think they gave the Polio vaccine in the classroom. It would be blasphemous in current times. You know we're in sad times when the TGA is currently manufacturing modern day iron lungs.,0,No
I love when the president gives himself new powers and makes up his own mandates without going through our elected representatives who are supposed to write the laws. Fascism and tyranny are hot this year!,1,Yes
I would consider this an IQ test for businesses. If you’re not smart enough to get a free vaccine that could save your life then you shouldn’t be working at that company.,0,No
One million people came across southern border and we just let them loose,1,Yes
Hundreds! 99.7 recovery rate and with right drugs it’s even higher.,0,No
The vaccine has been proven not to work. Why are all these government agencies exempt from taking it. The White House CDC FDA congress Pfizer Johnson and Johnson postal service all Chinese students studying in the US etc.,1,Yes
How many covid deaths this month in Baltimore compared to how many murders,1,Yes
"Seriously, I’m amazed at this level of ignorance and very disappointed. Jackson put himself and the team at risk because he hasn’t consulted a healthcare professional about COVID.",1,Yes
Got the Moderna vax. First shot no reaction. 2nd shot I felt fluey for a day. I'd get a booster in a NY minute if it gets recommended.,0,No
good from what I hear the nurses office is already full of kid with potential covid cases,0,No
FDA doesn't want the booster shots out yet because they want more testing to seev if the people are really going to need them but guess what CDC wants to go through with the booster now what does that tell you,0,No
"As a healthcare professional, I strongly encourage people to get the vaccine.",0,No
For all of the anti-vaxers where would our death toll be at now if we were all like you?,0,No
Please go get vaccinated we want to keep you all around a little longer,0,No
"getting vaccinated is for yourself yes but also for family, friends, community, country and the global health of humanity.",0,No
"Unless your religion is against ALL vaccines, the church should not get involvedâ€¦",0,No
"Doubtful, cuz we just read an article from one of the big guys at Pfizer that has a different view so more apt to listen to him than the US Government at this stage in the GAME",1,Yes
"Nope. The more I hear the government and media tell me I need to get it, the less chance that I will. Nobody can be trusted less than the government and media.",1,Yes
Vaccine is not going to rid the virus as long as man keeps making a virus that is resistant to each vaccine being made.,1,Yes
"First I heard, get the vaccine, that way you won't get covid. Now I hear, get the vaccine, you won't be as sick with the covid.",1,Yes
Doctors are already seeing complications from people who received the vaccine yet no one wants to report those facts.,1,Yes
"We have 4% of the world population and 20% of the world Covid deaths. Look at your own numbers here. In the last week we've almost as many infections as India, with a billion more people than we have. And a death rate not far from half ours. I can think of no measure by which that isn't awful. Yes, there are countries with higher death rates. But our high infection rate is obviously a huge problem. And it's escalating.",1,Yes
The police unions are resisting vaccine mandates.  Guess what the number one cause of death for police officers was last year and this year?  Yep. Covid.,1,Yes
You don't have to shut up. You don't have to obey. You're free to leave your job and go find one where a vaccine is not required. Complain about it as loudly and publicly as you want.,1,Yes
"Funny how hospitals in some areas are filling up with the unvaccinated who have COVID. If you have such little confidence in medical science, why go to the hospital?",1,Yes
Public health officials in PA have lost all credibility. It seems like they were hiding the data to promote vaccination.,1,Yes
"And a child's immune system is 99.98% effective, with none of the adverse events or nanobots swimming around inside them. It's a no brainer.",0,No
"Let's get those kids vaccinated , everyone stay safe out there and keep those vaccines coming. More is better than less !!!!",0,No
"When enough people in a community are vaccinated, it can provide protection to everyone—even those who have not been vaccinated. It does so by reducing the number of people able to spread the infection within that community, a process referred to as herd immunity.5 This is how public health officials have been able to eliminate (or nearly eliminate) diseases like polio, mumps, and measles, which once claimed millions of lives. When diseases aren't able to spread, they eventually die out.",0,No
"Cant wait until I get my booster shot, this vaccine will be the new norm especially for the the older folks and anyone with pre existing conditions. Remember to get a flu shot soon, this will also help and the flu bug was here to stay years ago, you can receive both at the same time. Stay safe out there. Like these red hats attacking a New York store owner, Guess they cant read the sign before entering the store.",0,No
"Got my notice to schedule my booster shot this morning, thanks to AHN made an appointment on line and I'm good to go ! A free shot, who can turn that down?",0,No
Those who refused to get vaccinated are going to have so many hospital bills. I donâ€™t know why anyone wouldnt do all they could to avoid getting sick.,0,No
Funny how many people find sick people to be hilarious. Man gotta love how pro-life we are.,0,No
Just get vaccinated already! Its simple and can save your life.,1,Yes
These statistics are really scary.,0,No
I don't believe these numbers,0,No
Also an entire hospital system fits on one chart. Thats a miniscule percent of even hospital patients.,0,No
This is a good.visual that is taking off on state sites as well. They need to add the second chart that breaks it into age ranges with normalized populations like Wisconsin department of health site does. The order of magnitude severe outcome reduction is compelling and those two pieces of data really tell the story well. That will be important as we keep getting higher vax rates because Ive seen much misinformation be pushed aboit countries that are 95% vaxed that those two graphs canneaily.and quickly show are BS.,1,Yes
So what you are saying is that it is like with covid. Patients that also had Pneumonia and/or influenza were called covid deaths. Got it. Seriously you liberals have to stop assuming that you are smarter than conservatives.,1,Yes
Hilarious fake chart.,1,Yes
That tells a clear story.,1,Yes

"I don’t care what you call it , if it keeps me alive lm in!",0,No
I would take the shot every month if I had to. I don't know what is in any vaccines and had to take those before starting school.,0,No
It was never meant to cure. If it did then the liberals in power would lose their power to put fear in us.,1,Yes
"Nope. The more I hear the government and media tell me I need to get it, the less chance that I will. Nobody can be trusted less than the government and media.",1,Yes
Because they don't work..... If it doesn't stop transmission or contraction it's not worth taking..,1,Yes
"The true answer, one that no pharma exec, politician or media will say is this is NOT a vaccine. Its a treatment. Calling it a 'vaccine' is malpractice and has done more harm because of it.",1,Yes
I know why they don’t last. Because they can make a lot more money if they can keep on selling them. And also so that the Democrats can steal a few more elections.,1,Yes
